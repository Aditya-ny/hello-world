Hello world,

My name is Aditya Sankar and I am an Intern-Software engineer living in New York. I develop web applications using Java technologies. I have good programming experience in JAVA for backend and web page design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Recently I started learning Python, using the book 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' by 'AL Sweigart' from no starch press. I really like it. I will update my GitHub profile with python scripts that I find are challenging. 

My hobbies are reading news, astronomy, running and swimming. 

Feel free to contact me at aditya.sep12@gmail.com
