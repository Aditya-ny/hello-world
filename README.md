First repository 5/23/2016

This repository contains all my programmed Python scripts. 

Please take a look. If you liked it, please let me know.

I started learning Python, using books and online tutorials. Books: 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' by 'AL Sweigart' from no starch press, Python Cookbook-O'Reilly & Introducing Python-Modern Computing in Simple Packages. 
I really like Python programming. I will update my GitHub profile with python scripts that I find are challenging. 

My hobbies are reading news, astronomy, running and swimming. 
I am also looking for new opporunities in electrical engineering.
