Hello GitHub,

My name is Aditya Sankar and I am an Intern-Software engineer living in New York. I develop web applications using Java technologies. I have good programming experience in JAVA for backend and web page design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I started learning Python, using books and online tutorials. Books: 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' by 'AL Sweigart' from no starch press, Python Cookbook-O'Reilly & Introducing Python-Modern Computing in Simple Packages. 
I really like Python programming. I will update my GitHub profile with python scripts that I find are challenging. 

My hobbies are reading news, astronomy, running and swimming. 
I am also looking for new opporunities in software engineering. 

Feel free to contact me at aditya.sep12@gmail.com.
