Hello GitHub,

My name is Aditya Prakash and I am an Intern-Engineer living in New York. I am working on a project Solar PV Tracking system. It is a significant project based on latest Smart Grid Technology.  

I started learning Python, using books and online tutorials. Books: 'Automate The Boring Stuff With Python' by 'AL Sweigart' from no starch press, Python Cookbook-O'Reilly & Introducing Python-Modern Computing in Simple Packages. 
I really like Python programming. I will update my GitHub profile with python scripts that I find are challenging. 

My hobbies are reading news, astronomy, running and swimming. 
I am also looking for new opporunities in electrical engineering. 

Feel free to contact me at aditya.sep12@gmail.com.
